# Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery
Use the CI/CD functionality from Gitlab to build applications and containers, run tests and deploy applications.

## Resources
**Video:** [How to ship code faster using continuous integration and delivery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGYoYSR-d98)
A short video (watch until 3:45) on what continuous integration is.

**Documentation:** [CI/CD concepts](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/introduction/)
Explains how continuous integration works within GitLab.

## Assignments
### 1. Your first pipeline
**Tutorial:** [Get started with GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/quick_start/)
Explains how the GitLab CI/CD works.

For your first pipeline we will create a simple job that only prints some text int the Gitlab interface.

Your task is to:
1. Create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file (locally) in the root of your repository (the one you are working in now).
2. Edit the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file (locally) so that it echo's 'Hello world!'.

To validate whether you have successfully implemented this objective you should push your code to Gitlab and check (on https://gitlab.com) whether the CI/CD pipeline has run successfully. Also check whether you can see the 'Hello world!' message is printed in the build job stage.  

### 2. Multiple build jobs
**Documentation:** [Basic Pipelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/pipeline_architectures.html#basic-pipelines)
This documentation explains how to create a basic CI pipeline.

**Documentation:** [Mocha](https://mochajs.org)
Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser.

In the provided template you will find a sample NodeJS app and a CSV containing film actors. First validate that the application works correctly on your laptop. Note that this application uses NPM, so you should initialize it first using `npm install`.

After you have validated that the application runs successfully, you should add a second build job to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. This build job should install the required NPM packages. Validate that the packages have been installed in the Gitlab CI logs on https://gitlab.com.

*Tip:* Use `image: node:20.11.0` in this build step to make sure NodeJS is installed on the build server.

### 3. Automated unit testing
With continuous integration you can automate the testing for your application.

Your task is to implement at least three unit tests for the application. Examples of test could be:
- Validate that all actors have been read successfully by doing a count on the number of lines read.
- Validate whether the correct amount of actors have been filtered when doing a search on an actor name.

Check whether they run successfully and if so, extend you CI to include a test job that runs after all the builds jobs. Also validate that the build fails when you (purposely) let a test fail.            

### 4. Job artifacts
**Documentation:** [Job artifacts](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/job_artifacts.html)
Jobs can output an archive of files and directories. This documentation explains how to achieve this in Gitlab CI.

Sometimes a job can produce a result, this is called a job artifact. In our example we can run our application in such a way that it produces a chart in the form of a text file.

Your task is to create a deploy stage job that stores the resulting chart as an artifact in Gitlab.
Set the target path to `chart.txt` and the expiration period to one week. Validate whether the artifact is created correctly on in the Gitlab CI logs on https://gitlab.com.         

### 5. Only produce product artifacts on merge
**Documentation:** [Pipelines for merge requests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/merge_request_pipelines.html)
Documentation on how to create specific pipelines for merge requests.

For our repository we would like to limit the amount of artifacts that are being created in order to save some disk space. We want to update our pipeline in such a way that our artifacts are only created when we create a merge request for merging a feature branch with the main branch. So on the feature branch the other jobs should run, but only if a merge request exists for merging with the main branch should you build the release job that produces the artifact.

Update your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file so that artifacts are created only when the feature branch has a merge request for merging with the main branch.

Validate that:
1. A push to the feature branch does not produce a job artifact.
2. A merge to the main branch does.
3. Creating a new merge request for merging with the main branch does.
4. Pushing a new commit to an existing merge request does.
